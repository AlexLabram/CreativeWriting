## Isolated ideas

- "Hard superhero" setting (per Worm) where people on a modern-ish Earth start to get powers that would be withon range of technology in a couple hundred years. Turns out this is due to cross-timeline bleed, after an enemy of humanity changed the past to slow down technological progress and make them easier to beat.
- Noah's Ark reinterpretation whereby the "ark" was a time travel machine which the inventor was really reluctant to use because of the moral implications of destroying all humanity born after the arrival time. Eventually *something* happens (alien invasion?) and everyone is gonna die anyway, so he jumps. Focus is on ethics of TT; punchline is that the revised timeline is our own and not much has changed (or at least not enough to avert the coming apocalypse).
  - the Flood becomes the Great Deletion of the time travel itself, filtered through Bronze Age tribal histories
  - [similar full-length story](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31936622-the-coming-of-noah-s-2nd-ark) (obscure)
  - [similar short story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Queen%27s_Race) (Asimov)
+ Random cosmic horror
  - "String-theoretic reality cancer" carried by light between stars with similar emission frequencies.  Discovered by theorist, who assumes it's ridiculous until the stars... start... going... out.

## World-based ideas

### Witherworld

Possible starting points for the story

- A London orphan-turned-homeless-turned-housebreaker breaks into the *wrong* building: a rogue magician's house, just as he's summoning an abomination through a breach he's made.  The young thief manages to instinctively channel the high ambient magic, creating a blast of lightning that fries the Lovecraftian monstrosity and the rogue, and passes out.  When he(?) wakes up, he finds that a group of magicians arrived five minutes after he keeled over, and have basically conscripted him.

Possible sub-plots (books)
- Missing person (child?) lost in the witherworld, having accidentally stumbled across a breach in the form of a Wild Path.
  - If they stumble into a fairy barrow, this essentially becomes a story of diplomacy and courtly politics as the protagonist and his team attempt to negotiate the child's return.
  - ...Whilst another less-agreeable fae faction is using this as an opportunity to cause trouble?
  - Good chance to delve into Shakespearean and Romantic fairy lore.
- [Nessie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness_Monster) reappears in Loch Ness, starts eating random boaters/hikers/swimmers.
  - First mentioned in 6th century as a water beast banished by Saint Columba.  This is well after the Seal - maybe a pre-existing story was attributed to the Saint, or maybe Nessie was trapped in the Loch when the Seal went up?
  - Columba was known as a [peregrini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Christianity#Peregrinatio) (one who lives away from their homeland).  Augustine's dictum was that "Christians should live a life of peregrinatio in the present world while awaiting the Kingdom of God" (Wikipedia's phrasing, need to look up the original).  Maybe there's a double meaning here: a fae tradition of visiting the wercworld (at the temporary cost of almost all their magical power) before returning to the Land of the Ever-Young?  If Columba was basically a fairy au-pair experimenting with the human lifestyle, this would explain why he could help Nessie return to the witherworld.
  - Because Nessie was sent to the witherworld after the Seal was in place, she was an easy target to be dragged back across the veil.  A goetian faction is using her as a quintessence pump: banish her widdershins, let her build up a charge of magic, summon her sidereally, harvest the magic.  This process is deeply unpleasant for Nessie, who has responded by becoming increasingly aggressive towards the local human population.
  - The protag and his co-workers are trying to figure out how to placate, vanquish or banish Nessie whilst simultaneously hunting down the goetians and avoiding trouble with the local police force.
- A maze opens up under central London (or another big city).  People promptly start going missing, emerging from Tube stations days after they went in having experienced only minutes, or otherwise winding up in unexpected locations.
  - I've just ordered [this book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Celtic-Design-Patterns-Aidan-Meehan/dp/0500277478) on celtic mazes - should be useful.
  - What is at the middle of the labyrinth?  Some kind of minotaur-equivalent?  What is their motivation for creating/populating it?
    - Maybe it's a cage for a dragon?  So the team has to get in, figure out how it got wired up to the wercworld, rescue/obliviate any lost civilians, dodge the dragon, and seal it behind them.  The dragon would be à la Smaug: intelligent enough to speak, unlike Nessie, but still perfectly willing to chow down on the occasional mortal.
  - Good opportunity to introduce [Neverwhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverwhere_(novel))-style otherworld low culture and [minor characters](https://labyrinth.fandom.com/wiki/Hoggle) on the fringes of the maze (i.e. out of reach of the central monster and not in any Fae Lord's territory) as the team try to figure out what kind of [Dungeon Keeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper) shit they've stumbled into.
  - Could use the [White Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dragon) (a poetic representation of the invading Anglo-Saxons)
    - It would presumably speak Old English, unless there's some Gift of Tongues bullshit going on.
    - ...So where did the Red Dragon get to?
- A hundred years ago, a known-friendly fae settlement mysteriously went quiet, with theurgist investigations revealing a Marie Celeste-type situation that was later used by Tolkien (a Light mage) as inspiration for [Moria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOiETFwf7ok).  The protagonist is asked to investigate as a way of hazing the new guy... but gets a bit further than expected.
  - I'll be honest, I have no idea what the actual plot would be here, but it's a hell of a set-up.
- Someone tries to use AlphaFold-style deep learning to "solve" magic and speed up the development of powerful new spells.  This is working fine... except that the passage of electronic signals through the system is enough to attract quintessence, and their computer starts to develop sentience.

Antagonist types:
- Free-range monsters from celtic or Arthurian myth (need to do some research!)
- Low-level goetian power-harvesting shenanigans (think early Sailor Moon, where the yо̄ma came up with such cunning plots as... stealing individual passenger buses, or making schoolkids feel sleepy, or hijacking late-night radio shows)
- Fae warbands doing a sterling impression of [dark](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Drow) [elves](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Elves), complete with sadism, slavery and slaughter.  Protag must identify their next target village and find a way to defeat them, whilst simultaneously fending off curious local police.
- Infiltrators - either potentially-friendly refugees from the witherworld masquerading as humans, individual shapechangers looking to replace a rich human and live the high life, or bona-fide fae spies mind-controlling important mundanes (politicians etc).  Or all three, and the protag spends half the book figuring out which is which.  (C.f. [Fool Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fool_Moon_(The_Dresden_Files)) from Jim Butcher's Dresden Files, wherein there are four kinds of werewolf, one of which is shifting blame for werewolf attacks to the other three.)
- Other more genocidal magical factions (think [Father Anderson](https://youtu.be/skJ0oLsNsE4) from Hellsing Abridged).
  - Maybe tie this into the fae refugees from above?  I.e. whilst hunting for the real threats they also have to keep a handle on the Church representatives who are attempting to go full Nazi on a bunch of relatively innocent fairies fleeing bloodshed.  Good analogy to treatment of immigrants by ethnic nationalists.
- Monsters-of-the-week from Graeco-Roman, Germanic or Norse myth
  - ...or even further afield depending on whether I manage any international world-building - Japanese, native North American, Central American, Semitic, Egyptian?
- Office politics turned murderous
  - There's a Darwin quote along the lines of: the greatest competition for any organism is from others of its own species.  (Must hunt down the quote.)  Or, put another way, the biggest threat to any bureacrat isn't their organisation's enemies; it's the guy in the office next door.
- Cells of an organised goetian faction (S.P.E.C.T.R.E. meets Golden Dawn)
  - Their leader: Morgen le Fay, returned from the witherworld as the seal weakens.  She's been operating like one of those crime lords who end up running their empires from prison, but now she's back.  All shall love her and despair.
  - ...But is she the final boss, or just the cat's-paw of a [fae leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomorians)?  Dun dun daaaaaah...
  - ...But are her schemes intended to succeed, or just to set the scenes for a mammoth ritual?  Dun dun daaaaaah...
- A broken-down magical servant from Roman times has delocalised (castle destroyed?) and promptly started metastatising into a god due to conceptual resonance.  This is not a good thing.


### Mereverse



### Floating World

Possible starting point: a non-Londoner trying to "test in" to the City.


## General brainstorming thoughts

+ Need more short cosmic horror!
+ Tarot cards as a brainstorming tool?
