Quick story sketch

1. Introduction
  - Set the scene
  - Bring on the judges
  - Bring on the defendant ("the madman")
1. Trial opening
  - Charges: attempted arson of the shuttle (weaving imagery)
  - Opening statement (bombshell 1) "I have a very unusual trait," the man said...
  - Interplay: Not possible; Proof; Relevancy?
1. Second phase
  - "as you know, time travel works by..."
  - Bombshell 3: RUNNING OUT!!!!!
1. Verdict
  - Sentenced
  - Return to home eras

...The above, and the intro, was originally written down in 2012.  Coming back to it in 2022, I can no longer remember precisely what bombshells 1, 2 and 3 were supposed to be.  The basic idea, though, was that time travel worked, and the Shuttle - the weird machine in the intro - was used to move people back and forth along the timeline.  The particular group gathered here today was for the purpose of prosecuting a guy who tried to blow the thing up.

I *think* Bombshell 1 was that the defendant could in some way sense his counterparts in other timelines.  Maybe demonstrated by describing the exact function of a guard's weapon... because there's a him a few universes over that made a break for it and got gunned down.

The "physics of time travel" interlude was effectively a discussion of closed-loop time travel, which - in this fic - amounts to constraining the space of probabilities to only include those timelines that are self-consistent.  So there is no way to kill your grandfather, because any such universe would cease to exist.  As there is a continuum of universes, this is not a problem; it's no worse than saying you constrain the probability space when you turn left rather than right.

Or is it?  Bombshell 3(?) was that, based on his para-sense, the defendant could see that universes were actually discrete rather than continuous, just very densely packed.  For most purposes the difference would be minimal, except that it meant the constant use of the Shuttle was cutting universes down faster than they could be generated.  Eventually we'd run out of internally consistent timelines.

The plan was to keep repeating the "tick... tick... TOCK" motif, right up to the last paragraph where the prosecutor(?) is wondering whether the now-convicted defendant could have been on to something.  The story would end with "tick... tick...", a la the Inception ending that made everyone groan.


## Chapter 1: The Hall of Echoes

Tick...

Tick...

TOCK

It takes a moment for my eyes to adjust to the gloom.  The windows of the room I have stepped into are small and set oddly low in the walls.  The little light they let in spills over the white marble floor, scattering off its smooth, unmarked surface.  The walls are crystalline: a semi-transparent silver-grey material worked into weird twisting arcs that rise to the shadowed ceiling like vines and branches of a frozen forest.

I step forward.

In another era, this room might have been filled with life, with music.  People might have gathered to see their visitors, to celebrate our arrival.  The scent of flowers might have... but this is a time of iron, of harsh law and harsher punishment.  It is a time of justice.  For this we have been called.

The dais in front of me is made of a dark wood, stained with age and use and roughly carved with splintered geometric shapes.  A long table runs along it, passing in front of six painted chairs.  The third chair, coloured a gentle shade of nut-brown, is mine, and two other visitors will sit on each side of me.  The sixth chair, huge and black, will remain empty.  We all have our little superstitions.

The device behind me begins to click again, and I turn to watch.  It is a strange machine, twice the height of a tall man.  Its polished bronze skin looks oddly out of place against the colourless wall; no surprise, all considered.  Traceries of emerald light ripple over its surface, their patterns shifting faster as the technology concealed inside reaches some secret climax.  The chamber at its centre begins to glow with a deep blue fire.

As the ticking stutters to a halt, as the flame flashes bright and fades away, a woman steps out.

------------------

I know her; by reputation only, of course.  Jai Kuna is her name, and her deeds are legendary.  At thirty years of age she is already an Empress by right of conquest.  In the 45th century, she marries into the royalty of a minor kingdom and, discarding her poor inbred husband, she proceeds to wreak a bloody trail across... but I sound like a history lesson.  It would only be appropriate to focus on the present.

The Jai's armour is simple, her sword short and straight - though ceremonial, still its design is functional.  Her clothes are soft tanned leather tattooed with complex patterns.  In her hair is braided the Everjewel, the symbol of her rule glowing a soft gold in the dim light.

A hint of disdain crosses her face as she greets the waiting officials.  They no doubt remind her of the court eunuchs she so infamously purged early in her reign, their ample waistlines and soft hands speaking of bureaucrats who have never held a sword.  Her own empire would never countenance such a thing: her subordinates were, notoriously, required to undergo military training before settling down to a life of paperwork, and were expected to maintain battle readiness at all times if they sought promotion.  All power flows from the barrel of a gun - or the period's equivalent - and the Jai clearly has no use for those who look down on the rough men standing as guarantors of their authority.





Finally, the defendant is frog-marched in, sandwiched between two burly guards.  A small man, quiet, lightly balding despite his apparent youth.  The expression on his face one of utter defeat as he gazes at the Time Chamber.

------------------

The officials lining the chamber gaze down on him implacably, not a twitch of emotion showing on their stony faces.  I know their phlegmatic affect is a lie.  How it must gall them, that the offender came from their own period, their self-proclaimed nomocracy: a perfect rulership of clockwork laws.  How they must hate that the multi-chronal nature of the offence forces them to bring in othertimers like ourselves to sit in judgement.
