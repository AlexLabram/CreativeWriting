## Prompt

Seagulls: souls of those who upset an old forgotten god of the sea ("rime of the ancient mariner" meets "the ring"? carelessness with an amulet that was cast up on the beach?)

## Plot synopsis

Story set in Victorian era.  A young gentleman scholar is visiting the beaches of Cornwall for his health when he strikes up a conversation with a drunken local, who mentions "old Alfred's queer necklace" as a local point of interest.

Alfred, a fisherman, is secretive at first, but eventually admits to owning a small gold amulet, with a marking in the shape of a bird flying over water, that he found in a small carved-stone coastal cave many years ago.  He claims it is a sigil of "the god of these waters", who he propitiates with offerings of "fish 'n likker", and that it brings him luck at sea.

The scholar offers to buy it off Alfred but is refused.  Not taking no for an answer, he persuades the fisherman's wife to sell it to him whilst Alfred is off at market (he never taking it too far from the shore).  After a brief run-in with a particularly annoying flock of seagulls, he takes the amulet to the London museum, where it becomes a prized part of a museum display on early Celtic religions.

The scholar returns to the village to see if Alfred can provide him with any more curios from the cave, but is shaken to find that he died at sea on his next fishing trip.

After several months, the museum agrees to loan their display to another museum overseas (Brittany?).  The scholar, now feeling distinctly nervous about the amulet, tries to persuade them to leave it behind but fails.  He agrees to travel with the exhibits to ensure they reach their destination.

On board a ship to Brittany, a storm blows up and the ferry rapidly approaches the point of capsizing.  The scholar, in a fit of panic, breaks open the amulet's crate and takes it to the foredeck, bringing with him raw fish and hard alcohol from the ferry's luxurious restaurant.  He offers everything on the foredeck up to the unnamed sea god if he will only spare the ship.
The sea immediately calms... after one last wave washes man, offerings and amulet off the deck.
Story told from the viewpoint of the curator?

## Perspective: the Carthage Club

Intro:
Setting: a London private member's club ("Carthage Club"? a la A. C. Clarke's White Hart)
Debate over the existence of fairies (c.f. Arthur Conan Doyle)

"Geoffrey, my good sir, you must be the closest we have to an expert.  What do you say about this plague of charlatans?"

The man in question was the head curator of a London-based private museum of curios, which, whilst not widely known, had a high reputation in certain circles.  He was also an excellent source of fascinating stories.  As he paused to dab his lip with a napkin, the attention of the group focused on him.

"Now I understand this opinion may be controversial," he said, "but I am comfortable in my own mind that the more *mechanical* view of the universe taught by our scientific brethren is wrong, or at least incomplete.  I cannot speak to the authenticity of these photographs in particular, but it would not surprise me were similar evidence, of a more verifiable nature, to become available."

"Oh, not you too," said the original querent.  "I had thought a man of letters such as yourself would be above such mummery."

"And so I was," the curator firmly rebutted, "until my current tenure at the Swartrod Museum exposed me to several most peculiar circumstances.  Why, the tale of young Horace alone, in my eyes, casts severe doubt upon a purely material universe."

This being a quintessential beginning to one of Geoffrey's famous yarns, the group of us gathered closer around him in anticipation.  Port was passed, cigars were lit, and soon we were prepared for the story's continuation.

"In light of subsequent events, I will not give Horace's last name for fear of upsetting his family.  Suffice to say that he was a moderately intelligent young man from a well-landed background who fancied himself something of a gentleman explorer.  Regrettably, he had little opportunity to extend the frontiers of human knowledge, having never in fact left Britain in his life.  This certainly did not prevent him from most eagerly investigating every location in which he found himself, and in this vein he made himself something of a nuisance at the Swartrod, getting into the stacks and bothering the more high-minded scholars.

"This was how I first met him, of course, and I along with many other members of the faculty were quietly relieved when his attention turned from the museums of London to the more remote areas of England.  After several months of blissful silence, we were thus rather shocked when he returned to us, practically bubbling over with excitement.  His explorations had led him - for no reason we could determine - to a small village in Dorset, wherein he had made a rather interesting discovery.  His standard investigatory practice of buying a round at the local public house had borne fruit when an inebriated local had vouchsafed to him the presence in the village of a curious artefact: a queer necklace owned by a fisherman named Old Alfred.

"The following day Horace sought out this good man, who proved to be a quiet sort; something of a recluse, in fact, despite being most thoroughly married.  Alfred proved reluctant to talk but, on realising that his interlocutor was unlikely to leave before his curiosity was sated, eventually reluctantly pulled out a gold amulet the size of a crown piece hung on an old strand of sailor's rope.  It was engraved with a primitive design resembling a gull on one side and a wave-like pattern on the other.

"The old fisherman claimed to have stumbled across this archæological gem in a small coastal cave made of worked stone, which he alleged - based on the carvings and mosaics therein - to have been a shrine to some forgotten heathen oceanic deity: 'the god of these waters', as he put it.  The amulet, his simple working-class logic thus concluded, was sacred to this god, and a potent source of good luck for a man in a dangerous water-borne profession.  He kept the idol placated, he said, with 'fresh fish and strong likker', and received in return a prodigious catch every time he set to sea, and a flock of seagulls to guide him home in rough weather.

"Horace, naturally, was fascinated by this literal fisherman's tale, and offered a frankly inappropriately large sum for the necklace.  Remarkably, though, Old Alfred refused this bounty, fearing in his primitive way that such an insult to the nameless god would bring disaster down upon him.

Fortunately for the field of archæology, our Horace was not to be gainsaid.  Noting the old man's reluctance to take the amulet too far from the sea, he waited until Alfred had ventured out of his home to a local farmer's market before approaching his wife.  This woman proved to be either less superstitious or more vulnerable to the lure of filthy lucre, and soon Horace was riding a coach back to London, rather poorer in cash but richer in cultural heritage.

"Upon arrival he sought me out at the Museum and
