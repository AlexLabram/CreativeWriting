I don't generally write poetry. There's a reason for that.

## Remedial Haiku

While eating breakfast outdoors at a London cafe in late summer / early autumn.

> The taste of dry dust <br />
> As winds flee the birth of dawn <br />
> A red sun rises

While looking at a stream... I think?

> A river of light <br />
> Hanging reeds trouble water <br />
> Cool stone lies timeless

Whilst pondering Yoda's "luminous beings are we" quote, in the context of mental health at the conscious/unconscious barrier.  Imagery: perfect petals of abstract thought blooming geometrically within a messy nest of pre-conscious leaves and twigs.

> Luminous flowers: <br />
> Seek not lightly to scorn these <br />
> Crude but virid leaves

## The Ilk of Paradise

In Xanadu old Mr Brown
A plastic greenhouse did decree
With running stands of two-by-four
And thermostat, and sliding door
And space for a cup of tea
With stainless tools and bare-armed toil
He danced his hands through perfumed soil
And from the pots burst rich and rampant vines
And twisted trunks cascading gold and green
And year-round roses, frangrance seized from spines
A hoarded heart of verdant life unseen

(Room for a second verse?  It's not like anyone remembers the middle verse of Xanadu...)

The fires ran cold, the earth sucked dry
The lilies wept sweet honey tears
The choir sang, the organ played
As Mr Brown to rest was laid
Concluding the work of years.
But I remember Xanadu
Its secret, silent, warming glow
A Khan's desire, a blessed isle
In urban archipelago
Mere plants can die, but dreams live on
Each echo stokes the godhead in the shrine
Tho' Mr Brown's greenhouse is gone
His Xanadu, I pray it will be mine.

To be populated (with appropriate levels of shame).
