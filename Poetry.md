I don't generally write poetry. There's a reason for that.

## Remedial Haiku

While eating breakfast outdoors at a London cafe in late summer / early autumn.

> The taste of dry dust <br />
> As winds flee the birth of dawn <br />
> A red sun rises

While looking at a stream... I think?

> A river of light <br />
> Hanging reeds trouble water <br />
> Cool stone lies timeless

Whilst pondering Yoda's "luminous beings are we" quote, in the context of mental health at the conscious/unconscious barrier.  Imagery: perfect petals of abstract thought blooming geometrically within a messy nest of pre-conscious leaves and twigs.

> Luminous flowers: <br />
> Seek not lightly to scorn these <br />
> Crude but virid leaves

## The Ilk of Paradise

In Xanadu old Mr Brown <br />
A plastic greenhouse did decree <br />
With running stands of two-by-four <br />
And thermostat, and sliding door <br />
And space for a cup of tea <br />
With stainless tools and bare-armed toil <br />
He danced his hands through perfumed soil <br />
And from the pots burst rich and rampant vines <br />
And twisted trunks cascading gold and green <br />
And year-round roses, frangrance seized from spines <br />
A hoarded heart of verdant life unseen

(Room for a second verse?  It's not like anyone remembers the middle verse of Xanadu...)

The fires ran cold, the earth sucked dry <br />
The lilies wept sweet honey tears <br />
The choir sang, the organ played <br />
As Mr Brown to rest was laid <br />
Concluding the work of years. <br />
But I remember Xanadu <br />
Its secret, silent, warming glow <br />
A Khan's desire, a blessed isle <br />
In urban archipelago <br />
Mere plants can die, but dreams live on <br />
Each echo stokes the godhead in the shrine <br />
Tho' Mr Brown's greenhouse is gone <br />
His Xanadu, I pray it will be mine.

To be populated (with appropriate levels of shame).
