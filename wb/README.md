# World building index file

## About this document

This is a scribble file for world-building ideas under development.

Worlds that are sufficiently developed will be split out into the [/wb](wb) subfolder.  Worlds that I don't think I can progress further will be moved to [/wb/WB_Dead.md](wb/WB_Dead).  Plots based on these worlds will eventually be moved to /orig.

## General thoughts on world-building

The purpose of world-building isn't to advance a story but to constrain it.  It puts the burden on the writer to consider how a narrative thread would naturally develop given this background, and then spin those threads into an appealing story arc.

This is not a bad thing!  Per EV Wright's "Gadsby", the constraints make the story.  But it requires the writer to switch hats mid-way: when you're writing the actual story, you're essentially playing chess against the world you just built!
