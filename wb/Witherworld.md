# Wiðerworld

Notes:
- I've been bouncing back and forth between sections here, so some of the terminology I've invented in later sections hasn't been applied to the earlier ones.  I'll edit later.
- I do intend to use traditional orthography (ð, þ, æ, etc) wherever possible, no matter how much it annoys everyone around me.  [Eth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eth) 'em if they can't take a joke.

## Elevator pitch

Why do ancient myths and legends have so much magic in when so little is to be found in the modern world?  The reason: over a millennium ago, the witherworld - the realm of magic - was sealed away from our mundane reality for our safety, with all the fantastic creatures and sinister fae-folk on the other side.  Only a handful of families and organisations remain to keep the old crafts alive, carefully husbanding the dregs of their forebears' power.

But the seal is weakening, and fractures - "breaches" - have started to appear where the magical wells up into the mundane.  Local people gain strange powers or vanish, weird cryptids emerge and befriend (or eat) passers-by, and things deteriorate until - potentially - the seal collapses and reality breaks down across Britain.

The magical organisations are desperately trying to stem the tide, patching breaches as they emerge and hunting down intruders from beyond.  However, they are handicapped by factionalism, opposed by power-crazed practitioners, and stuck dodging the increasing scrutiny of the mundane government (not to mention the occasional paranormal investigator). And, as the seal erodes further, it's only going to get worse from here...

## Nature of magic

Magic is both a field and a particle.  The density of the magical field increases as you go further widdershins into the otherworld, and decreases as you travel in a sidereal direction back to mundane reality.  However, this field can also crystallise into a flow of particles - "dust", "luminiferous æther", "quintessence", "philosophic mercury", "rheum", etc - which can be brought back into the mundane world, be distilled from low-quintessence Earthly sources, or geyser up from breaches.

## Nature of the witherworld

To be confirmed (see "outstanding questions"), but will have heavy influence from pre-Norman mythology (celtic, roman, anglo-saxon, picts, etc).

Aka the [Otherworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Otherworld), Fairyland, Underhill, Avalon, Tír na nÓg, Elysium, etc etc.

## History (overview)

Britain has always had a strong connection to the otherworld, with the early Britons (Celts) mingling and interbreeding with the fae, and legendary beasts roaming the land.  When the Romans took over in the 1st century AD, their theurgists regimented this connection as they had done elsewhere, essentially imposing a loose sort of border control (a magical Hadrian's Wall?  [Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius)' Wall maybe?) and fighting back against incursions from the other side, whether by sadistic fairy warbands, malevolent infiltrators, powerful monsters, or goetian practitioners trying to gather power at the expense of others.

By the end of the 4th century, Roman rule was collapsing and their ability to police their own borders - supernatural or otherwise - was greatly diminished.  As the Anglo-Saxons circled and the fae began to press in, one local warlord - King Artur - tried to create a new arrangement with the fae: the Pact of Caerleon, which tied his kingdom of Logres to the adjacent otherworld kingdom of Avalon via his marriage to the faerie queen Gwenyvar.

Unfortunately the new nation didn't survive for long, collapsing under pressure from both human and fae enemies and ultimately falling to betrayal from within.  As Artur's castle of Camelot fell, its theurgists worked together on a huge ritual - the [Laleocan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lailoken) Seal - to permanently divide the otherworld (now known as the [Wiðerworld](https://bosworthtoller.com/36191)) from mundane reality (the [Wercworld](https://bosworthtoller.com/1983)), protecting his human citizens from fae marauders and removing the human invaders' magical support.  

The ritual worked perfectly, turning the existing Roman border into an almost impassable barricade and utterly devastating the Anglo-Saxon [draicrafters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_in_Anglo-Saxon_England#Terminology) (who relied much more on the wilder kinds of magic than the Romans).  However, it did nothing to prevent the final collapse of Roman civilisation in Britain and the move to Anglo-Saxon dominance.  (Witherworld and Wercworld are Anglo-Saxon names, because the Roman/Brythonic nations didn't really survive long enough for their own names for these phenomena to stick...)

Over the following fifteen hundred years the Seal held firm, leaking only small amounts of magic into the Wercworld, which were carefully collected and husbanded by the surviving magical traditions for use in small workings.  However, in the last few decades, the Seal has begun to noticeably weaken, with breaches spilling crazy amounts of magical quintessence into the wercworld and allowing both mundane humans and witherworlders to cross over.

<Insert list of particularly bad breaches here>

In recent years, the breaches have become common enough that organised incursions are starting to become a real danger.  Fae lords are looking at the mortal world, and they're hungry...

## Magical traditions

The extant magical factions can be broken down as follows:
- Theurgic: descendants of the Roman high magic traditions, using ritual to strengthen and protect the kingdom.  Mostly keen on keeping things orderly, which in the modern climate means protecting the Seal at all costs.  Theurgic magic can be divided into Light and Dark.
  - Light magic is that which is passed on via organisations.  Light factions tend to be pro-standardisation and comparatively keen on knowledge codification and sharing (at least among those they deem worthy).  They sneer at eclectic magic that can only be used by certain people or bloodlines, are quietly worried by magics that rely strongly on the practitioner's emotional state, and are often a bit too keen to steal knowledge from Dark practitioners "for the greater good".
  - Dark magic is that which is passed on via family traditions or peer-to-peer relationships (e.g. master/apprentice).  They hoard knowledge, building their lineages' personal spell libraries and resources over the centuries.  They are far more open to wild magics, and are the main source of Anglo-Saxon magics since they absorbed most of the draicrafter groups that survived the Seal.  Sometimes accused and/or guilty of having goetian sympathies.
- Goetian: descendants of the Roman low magic traditions, or similarly-inclined post-Roman groups.  They generally believe that power is where you find it, and aren't too worried about collateral damage when they seek it.  Their most infamous practitioner is Morgen le Fay, who helped bring down Camelot apparently in revenge for their efforts to shut down her antics. (But was that the real reason?  Dun dun daaaaah...)

## Plot points

Possible starting points for the story
- A London orphan-turned-homeless-turned-housebreaker breaks into the *wrong* building: a rogue magician's house, just as he's summoning an abomination through a breach he's made.  The young thief manages to instinctively channel the high ambient magic, creating a blast of lightning that fries the Lovecraftian monstrosity and the rogue, and passes out.  When he(?) wakes up, he finds that a group of magicians arrived five minutes after he keeled over, and have basically conscripted him.

Possible sub-plots (books)
- Missing person (child?) lost in the witherworld, having accidentally stumbled across a breach in the form of a Wild Path.
  - If they stumble into a fairy barrow, this essentially becomes a story of diplomacy and courtly politics as the protagonist and his team attempt to negotiate the child's return.
  - ...Whilst another less-agreeable fae faction is using this as an opportunity to cause trouble?
  - Good chance to delve into Shakespearean and Romantic fairy lore.
- [Nessie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness_Monster) reappears in Loch Ness, starts eating random boaters/hikers/swimmers.
  - First mentioned in 6th century as a water beast banished by Saint Columba.  This is well after the Seal - maybe a pre-existing story was attributed to the Saint, or maybe Nessie was trapped in the Loch when the Seal went up?
  - Columba was known as a [peregrini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Christianity#Peregrinatio) (one who lives away from their homeland).  Augustine's dictum was that "Christians should live a life of peregrinatio in the present world while awaiting the Kingdom of God" (Wikipedia's phrasing, need to look up the original).  Maybe there's a double meaning here: a fae tradition of visiting the wercworld (at the temporary cost of almost all their magical power) before returning to the Land of the Ever-Young?  If Columba was basically a fairy au-pair experimenting with the human lifestyle, this would explain why he could help Nessie return to the witherworld.
  - Because Nessie was sent to the witherworld after the Seal was in place, she was an easy target to be dragged back across the veil.  A goetian faction is using her as a quintessence pump: banish her widdershins, let her build up a charge of magic, summon her sidereally, harvest the magic.  This process is deeply unpleasant for Nessie, who has responded by becoming increasingly aggressive towards the local human population.
  - The protag and his co-workers are trying to figure out how to placate, vanquish or banish Nessie whilst simultaneously hunting down the goetians and avoiding trouble with the local police force.
- A maze opens up under central London (or another big city).  People promptly start going missing, emerging from Tube stations days after they went in having experienced only minutes, or otherwise winding up in unexpected locations.
  - I've just ordered [this book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Celtic-Design-Patterns-Aidan-Meehan/dp/0500277478) on celtic mazes - should be useful.
  - What is at the middle of the labyrinth?  Some kind of minotaur-equivalent?  What is their motivation for creating/populating it?
    - Maybe it's a cage for a dragon?  So the team has to get in, figure out how it got wired up to the wercworld, rescue/obliviate any lost civilians, dodge the dragon, and seal it behind them.  The dragon would be à la Smaug: intelligent enough to speak, unlike Nessie, but still perfectly willing to chow down on the occasional mortal.
  - Good opportunity to introduce [Neverwhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverwhere_(novel))-style otherworld low culture and [minor characters](https://labyrinth.fandom.com/wiki/Hoggle) on the fringes of the maze (i.e. out of reach of the central monster and not in any Fae Lord's territory) as the team try to figure out what kind of [Dungeon Keeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper) shit they've stumbled into.
  - Could use the [White Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dragon) (a poetic representation of the invading Anglo-Saxons)
    - It would presumably speak Old English, unless there's some Gift of Tongues bullshit going on.
    - ...So where did the Red Dragon get to?
- A hundred years ago, a known-friendly fae settlement mysteriously went quiet, with theurgist investigations revealing a Marie Celeste-type situation that was later used by Tolkien (a Light mage) as inspiration for [Moria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOiETFwf7ok).  The protagonist is asked to investigate as a way of hazing the new guy... but gets a bit further than expected.
  - I'll be honest, I have no idea what the actual plot would be here, but it's a hell of a set-up.

Antagonist types:
- Free-range monsters from celtic or Arthurian myth (need to do some research!)
- Low-level goetian power-harvesting shenanigans (think early Sailor Moon, where the yо̄ma came up with such cunning plots as... stealing individual passenger buses, or making schoolkids feel sleepy, or hijacking late-night radio shows)
- Fae warbands doing a sterling impression of [dark](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Drow) [elves](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Elves), complete with sadism, slavery and slaughter.  Protag must identify their next target village and find a way to defeat them, whilst simultaneously fending off curious local police.
- Infiltrators - either potentially-friendly refugees from the witherworld masquerading as humans, individual shapechangers looking to replace a rich human and live the high life, or bona-fide fae spies mind-controlling important mundanes (politicians etc).  Or all three, and the protag spends half the book figuring out which is which.  (C.f. [Fool Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fool_Moon_(The_Dresden_Files)) from Jim Butcher's Dresden Files, wherein there are four kinds of werewolf, one of which is shifting blame for werewolf attacks to the other three.)
- Other more genocidal magical factions (think [Father Anderson](https://youtu.be/skJ0oLsNsE4) from Hellsing Abridged).
  - Maybe tie this into the fae refugees from above?  I.e. whilst hunting for the real threats they also have to keep a handle on the Church representatives who are attempting to go full Nazi on a bunch of relatively innocent fairies fleeing bloodshed.  Good analogy to treatment of immigrants by ethnic nationalists.
- Monsters-of-the-week from Graeco-Roman, Germanic or Norse myth
  - ...or even further afield depending on whether I manage any international world-building - Japanese, native North American, Central American, Semitic, Egyptian?
- Office politics turned murderous
  - There's a Darwin quote along the lines of: the greatest competition for any organism is from others of its own species.  (Must hunt down the quote.)  Or, put another way, the biggest threat to any bureacrat isn't their organisation's enemies; it's the guy in the office next door.
- Cells of an organised goetian faction (S.P.E.C.T.R.E. meets Golden Dawn)
  - Their leader: Morgen le Fay, returned from the witherworld as the seal weakens.  She's been operating like one of those crime lords who end up running their empires from prison, but now she's back.  All shall love her and despair.
  - ...But is she the final boss, or just the cat's-paw of a [fae leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomorians)?  Dun dun daaaaaah...
  - ...But are her schemes intended to succeed, or just to set the scenes for a mammoth ritual?  Dun dun daaaaaah...
- A broken-down magical servant from Roman times has delocalised (castle destroyed?) and promptly started metastatising into a god due to conceptual resonance.  This is not a good thing.

## Outstanding questions

- What is the geometry of the witherworld?
  - How can 3D species exist in a 4D space?  Are there strata, like different pages of a comic book?  If so, how do people move between levels, and how densely packed are they?
    - I have this vague mental image of navigating the witherworld being a bit like the Tron Legacy [lightcycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqSuRdkglxM) game.
- What is the geography of the nearby witherworld?
  - Any map of this area should look like a [Hogwarts class timetable](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/1991%E2%80%931992_school_year?file=PSClassTimetable.jpg) or a [t-SNE](https://towardsdatascience.com/t-distributed-stochastic-neighbor-embedding-t-sne-bb60ff109561) or [SOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map#/media/File:Self_oraganizing_map_cartography.jpg) visualisation: you should get the very strong impression that this is an artificially-flattened version of something a lot weirder.
- What factions exist in the witherworld?
  - Need to go back over a lot of Celtic, Roman, Germanic and Norse myth!  Quick cheat: assume that different names = different factions (e.g. [tylwyth teg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tylwyth_Teg) vs [sídhe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aos_S%C3%AD) vs [fae/fāta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy).  Also: [Fomorians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomorians).
  - Also need to be very careful with anachronisms, e.g.: 
    - using Middle English words where these would only have arisen after the sealing; 
    - using later takes on mythology (such as Malory's [Le Morte d'Arthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Morte_d%27Arthur) without explaining how the author knew the true histories; 
    - losing track of who ruled where at what time.  My Dad does a lot of archaeology relating to this timezone (he was a volunteer on the [Marlow Warlord](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/metal-detector-enthusiasts-find-6th-century-anglo-saxon-warriors-grave/) site) - maybe ask him for some historical references?
  - How can I weave Lovecraftian monstrosities into this somehow?
  - What happened to magicians that were on the wrong side when the barrier came down?
- What factions exist amongst magicians?  Which faction is the protagonist attached to?  What wacky team-mates does he/she have to get along with?
- What happened when Britain was Christianised?  In what ways did this make things better (meddling with fairies now considered outright heresy, not just bloody dangerous) or worse (magical practitioners burned, books prohibited)?
  - If any magical traditions managed to make nice with the Church, what happened when the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation) swept through and Roman Catholicism was proscribed?
- How much does the mundane world know about what's going on?  What sources of information do they have?  Do breaches show up on satellite?
- What is happening overseas?  Was the sealing limited to Britain?
  - If not, how did other countries deal with having the worlds forcibly separated and magic basically eliminated?
  - If so, what happened to overseas links to the widderworld?  
- What, *precisely*, happened when magic was sealed?
  - What led up to it?  E.g. lawful Roman influence vs chaotic Britons, then vs equally-chaotic Anglo-Saxons.  Magic closed down because there would be no-one left willing and able to restrain it?  Or in a failed attempt to cripple the invaders?
  - Dramatis personae and connection to Geoffrey of Monmouth's Arthurian romance.  ("Morgana le Fay" in particular is a very obvious link!  Need to figure out what "le Fay" would have been in Brythonic.)
  - What was the immediate fall-out?  Impact on demographics / politics / economy, in Britain / witherworld / abroad.
  - How did magical traditions survive until the present day?  (Good excuse to work in lots of mediæval occult lore and dramatis personae!)
- How does Witherworld magic work?
  - Good excuse to introduce my spells-as-proteins metaphor, possibly mixed with my spells-as-tsukumogami metaphor.  Put together - spells are "knotwork spirits": sequential expressions of will by the caster whose behaviour depends on how that expression naturally folds itself up on release.  Some are transient (fireballs have only the intelligence and stamina required to throw themselves across a landscape and blow up); some are persistent (
  - Some spirits have resonance with a particular concept (or prior set of cast spells) - for example, fireballs resonate with elemental Fire, and the greatest spells of battle can resonate with e.g. the Mórrígan.
    - Magically-literate invaders can effectively redraw the resonance pattern through spreading the worship of their own gods.
  - Spirits intended to stay small, such as magical servants, are often bound to a place simply because tying the location into the spell reduces their conceptual resonance and stops them maturing into full-fledged gods.  The Roman Lares and Penates, or more recently brownies, are examples of this.
  - There are also rituals, which are basically a way of hardwiring a lot of the initial conditions that affect the fold/knot pattern.  Per the old factoid about amphibians having a lot more DNA than humans because their eggs need to handle lots of different temperatures etc, this speeds up the rate at which you can 
- How do Witherworld (theurgic) practitioners learn their magic?  In what order are spells taught?  Are there specific prerequisite exercises ("stare at this knot until it starts to make sense")?  At what point are practitioners capable in combat and/or with rituals?

## Influences

- The gradual breakdown of equilibrium is basically a metaphor for climate change.
  - The Goetians are something along the lines of oil sheiks in this metaphor: they're exploiting a [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) situation.
    - I like [this article's take](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/) on office politics, which splits people into losers (who, faced with TotC, think "I'd better not graze any more sheep then"), clueless (who think "well, one more sheep won't hurt, right?") and sociopaths (who think "I'd better add as many sheep as possible, then, before everyone else can grow their flock").  Goetians are basically freelance sociopaths.
- I like the [Laundry Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laundry_Files)' approach to magic: that it is basically extreme maths, with certain calculations resonating through the [Platonic realm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_idealism) to other realities.  Can't rip this off directly, since everyone in Europe between the Greeks and the Renaissance sucked balls at mathematics, but I'll include plenty of hat tips.
  - "Both a field and a particle" is a reference to quantum field theory
  - The idea of extra directions - widdershins and sidereal - is sorta-kinda related to the mathematics of imaginary and complex numbers, which makes descriptions like "north of the North Pole", "behind the West Wind" and "over hill and under dale" distressingly literal.
    - ... of course this would imply that there are *two* widdershins directions (for the same reason that the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) is symmetrical).  Summer and Winter Courts?
  - I also like the LF's approach of saving the world with reality-warping powers involving a lot of meetings and paperwork.  It just feels so damn plausible.
  - The collapse of the seal is basically [Case Nightmare Green](https://thelaundryfiles.fandom.com/wiki/CASE_NIGHTMARE_GREEN), which itself is ripped from Lovecraft.  ("When the stars were right, They could plunge from world to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong, They could not live.")
- [Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Strange_%26_Mr_Norrell) has some very vivid imagery, and a similar (albeit somewhat more positive) take on the otherworld and the return of magic.
  - "This land is all too shallow / It is painted on the sky / And it shivers like the wind-swept leaves / When the Raven King goes by..."
- The [Rivers of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Grant_(book_series)) series has a few similar themes: a handful of practitioners working to preserve order as the magic begins to return to England.
- The orphan-thief entry point is a bit similar to how Jay (Will Smith) from [Men in Black](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119654/) got involved in extra-terrestrial affairs, albeit with a slightly stronger risk of being obliviated into a coma if he [refuses the call](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCallKnowsWhereYouLive).
  - "A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it." - best line ever
- The breaches are reminiscent of [Primeval](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0808096/), a TV show about Suddenly Dinosaurs.
- I need to be careful *not* to take too much influence from Artemis Fowl.  'Tis a silly series.
- The sense that all the crazy has been trapped behind thin walls is reminiscent of the [Nasuverse](https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Nasuverse)'s [Reverse Side of the World](https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Reverse_Side_of_the_World) where the Age of Man never kicked off and the Age of Gods still holds sway.
