# Wiðerworld

Notes:
+ I've been bouncing back and forth between sections here, so some of the terminology I've invented in later sections hasn't been applied to the earlier ones.  I'll edit later.
+ I do intend to use traditional orthography (ð, þ, æ, etc) wherever possible, no matter how much it annoys everyone around me.  [Eth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eth) 'em if they can't take a joke.

## Elevator pitch

Why do ancient myths and legends have so much magic in when so little is to be found in the modern world?  The reason: over a millennium ago, the witherworld - the realm of magic - was sealed away from our mundane reality for our safety, with all the fantastic creatures and sinister fae-folk on the other side.  Only a handful of families and organisations remain to keep the old crafts alive, carefully husbanding the dregs of their forebears' power.

But the seal is weakening, and fractures - "breaches" - have started to appear where the magical wells up into the mundane.  Local people gain strange powers or vanish, weird cryptids emerge and befriend (or eat) passers-by, and things deteriorate until - potentially - the seal collapses and reality breaks down across Britain.

The magical organisations are desperately trying to stem the tide, patching breaches as they emerge and hunting down intruders from beyond.  However, they are handicapped by factionalism, opposed by power-crazed practitioners, and stuck dodging the increasing scrutiny of the mundane government (not to mention the occasional paranormal investigator). And, as the seal erodes further, it's only going to get worse from here...

## Nature of magic

Magic is both a field and a particle.  The density of the magical field increases as you go further widdershins into the otherworld, and decreases as you travel in a sidereal direction back to mundane reality.  However, this field can also crystallise into a flow of particles - "dust", "luminiferous æther", "quintessence", "philosophic mercury", "rheum", "mana", etc - which can be brought back into the mundane world, be distilled from low-quintessence Earthly sources, or geyser up from breaches.

Spells powered using this pseudo-substance are "sequential expressions of the caster's will".  On release, this folds up like a knot or a protein, with the aggregate effect depending on the folded shape (so isn't completely predictable, making spellcrafting more of an art than a science).  Being expressions of will, all spells are at least slightly sapient (knotwork spirits, kamifuda)... but some are really really dumb since you don't need a high IQ to shoot across a battlefield and explode in the enemy's face.  Spells can be transient or persistent depending on folding pattern.

Some spirits have resonance with a particular concept (or prior set of cast spells) - for example, fireballs resonate with elemental Fire, and the greatest spells of battle can resonate with e.g. the Mórrígan.  Spirits intended to stay small, such as magical servants, are thus often bound to a place simply because tying the location into the spell reduces their conceptual resonance and stops them maturing into full-fledged gods.  The Roman Lares and Penates, or more recently brownies, are examples of this.

There are also rituals, which are basically a way of hardwiring a lot of the initial conditions that affect the fold/knot pattern and could cause a misfold.  Per the old factoid about amphibians having a lot more DNA than humans because their eggs need to handle lots of different temperatures etc, this greatly increases the amount of complexity you can get from a given amount of chanting, which is useful both for Great Spells (aka Great Rituals for this reason) and for rapid-fire combat spells.

## Nature of the witherworld

To be confirmed (see "outstanding questions"), but will have heavy influence from pre-Norman mythology (celtic, roman, anglo-saxon, picts, etc).

Aka the [Otherworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Otherworld), Fairyland, Underhill, Avalon, Tír na nÓg, Elysium, etc etc.

## History (overview)

Britain has always had a strong connection to the otherworld, with the early Britons (Celts) mingling and interbreeding with the fae, and legendary beasts roaming the land.  When the Romans took over in the 1st century AD, their theurgists regimented this connection as they had done elsewhere, essentially imposing a loose sort of border control (a magical Hadrian's Wall?  [Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius)' Wall maybe?) and fighting back against incursions from the other side, whether by sadistic fairy warbands, malevolent infiltrators, powerful monsters, or goetian practitioners trying to gather power at the expense of others.

By the end of the 4th century, Roman rule was collapsing and their ability to police their own borders - supernatural or otherwise - was greatly diminished.  As the Anglo-Saxons circled and the fae began to press in, one local warlord - King Artur - tried to create a new arrangement with the fae: the Pact of Caerleon, which tied his kingdom of Logres to the adjacent otherworld kingdom of Avalon via his marriage to the faerie queen Gwenyvar.

Unfortunately the new nation didn't survive for long, collapsing under pressure from both human and fae enemies and ultimately falling to betrayal from within.  As Artur's castle of Camelot fell, its theurgists worked together on a huge ritual - the [Laleocan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lailoken) Seal - to permanently divide the otherworld (now known as the [Wiðerworld](https://bosworthtoller.com/36191)) from mundane reality (the [Wercworld](https://bosworthtoller.com/1983)), protecting his human citizens from fae marauders and removing the human invaders' magical support.  

The ritual worked perfectly, turning the existing Roman border into an almost impassable barricade and utterly devastating the Anglo-Saxon [draicrafters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_in_Anglo-Saxon_England#Terminology) (who relied much more on the wilder kinds of magic than the Romans).  However, it did nothing to prevent the final collapse of Roman civilisation in Britain and the move to Anglo-Saxon dominance.  (Witherworld and Wercworld are Anglo-Saxon names, because the Roman/Brythonic nations didn't really survive long enough for their own names for these phenomena to stick...)

Over the following fifteen hundred years the Seal held firm, leaking only small amounts of magic into the Wercworld, which were carefully collected and husbanded by the surviving magical traditions for use in small workings.  However, in the last few decades, the Seal has begun to noticeably weaken, with breaches spilling crazy amounts of magical quintessence into the wercworld and allowing both mundane humans and witherworlders to cross over.

<Insert list of particularly bad breaches here>

In recent years, the breaches have become common enough that organised incursions are starting to become a real danger.  Fae lords are looking at the mortal world, and they're hungry...

## Magical traditions

The extant magical factions can be broken down as follows:
+ Theurgic: descendants of the Roman high magic traditions, using ritual to strengthen and protect the kingdom.  Mostly keen on keeping things orderly, which in the modern climate means protecting the Seal at all costs.  Theurgic magic can be divided into Light and Dark.
  - Light magic is that which is passed on via organisations.  Light factions tend to be pro-standardisation and comparatively keen on knowledge codification and sharing (at least among those they deem worthy).  They sneer at eclectic magic that can only be used by certain people or bloodlines, are quietly worried by magics that rely strongly on the practitioner's emotional state, and are often a bit too keen to steal knowledge from Dark practitioners "for the greater good".
  - Dark magic is that which is passed on via family traditions or peer-to-peer relationships (e.g. master/apprentice).  They hoard knowledge, building their lineages' personal spell libraries and resources over the centuries.  They are far more open to wild magics, and are the main source of Anglo-Saxon magics since they absorbed most of the draicrafter groups that survived the Seal.  Sometimes accused and/or guilty of having goetian sympathies.
+ Goetian: descendants of the Roman low magic traditions, or similarly-inclined post-Roman groups.  They generally believe that power is where you find it, and aren't too worried about collateral damage when they seek it.  Their most infamous practitioner is Morgen le Fay, who helped bring down Camelot apparently in revenge for their efforts to shut down her antics. (But was that the real reason?  Dun dun daaaaah...)

## Outstanding questions

+ What is the geometry of the witherworld?
  - How can 3D species exist in a 4D space?  Are there strata, like different pages of a comic book?  If so, how do people move between levels, and how densely packed are they?
    - I have this vague mental image of navigating the witherworld being a bit like the Tron Legacy [lightcycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqSuRdkglxM) game.
+ What is the geography of the nearby witherworld?
  - Any map of this area should look like a [Hogwarts class timetable](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/1991%E2%80%931992_school_year?file=PSClassTimetable.jpg) or a [t-SNE](https://towardsdatascience.com/t-distributed-stochastic-neighbor-embedding-t-sne-bb60ff109561) or [SOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map#/media/File:Self_oraganizing_map_cartography.jpg) visualisation: you should get the very strong impression that this is an artificially-flattened version of something a lot weirder.
+ What factions exist in the witherworld?
  - Need to go back over a lot of Celtic, Roman, Germanic and Norse myth!  Quick cheat: assume that different names = different factions (e.g. [tylwyth teg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tylwyth_Teg) vs [sídhe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aos_S%C3%AD) vs [fae/fāta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy).  Also: [Fomorians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomorians).
  - Also need to be very careful with anachronisms, e.g.: 
    - using Middle English words where these would only have arisen after the sealing; 
    - using later takes on mythology (such as Malory's [Le Morte d'Arthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Morte_d%27Arthur) without explaining how the author knew the true histories; 
    - losing track of who ruled where at what time.  My Dad does a lot of archaeology relating to this timezone (he was a volunteer on the [Marlow Warlord](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/metal-detector-enthusiasts-find-6th-century-anglo-saxon-warriors-grave/) site) - maybe ask him for some historical references?
  - How can I weave Lovecraftian monstrosities into this somehow?
  - What happened to magicians that were on the wrong side when the barrier came down?
+ What factions exist amongst magicians?  Which faction is the protagonist attached to?  What wacky team-mates does he/she have to get along with?
+ What happened when Britain was Christianised?  In what ways did this make things better (meddling with fairies now considered outright heresy, not just bloody dangerous) or worse (magical practitioners burned, books prohibited)?
  - If any magical traditions managed to make nice with the Church, what happened when the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation) swept through and Roman Catholicism was proscribed?
+ How much does the mundane world know about what's going on?  What sources of information do they have?  Do breaches show up on satellite?
+ What is happening overseas?  Was the sealing limited to Britain?
  - If not, how did other countries deal with having the worlds forcibly separated and magic basically eliminated?
  - If so, what happened to overseas links to the widderworld?  
+ What, *precisely*, happened when magic was sealed?
  - What led up to it?  E.g. lawful Roman influence vs chaotic Britons, then vs equally-chaotic Anglo-Saxons.  Magic closed down because there would be no-one left willing and able to restrain it?  Or in a failed attempt to cripple the invaders?
  - Dramatis personae and connection to Geoffrey of Monmouth's Arthurian romance.  ("Morgana le Fay" in particular is a very obvious link!  Need to figure out what "le Fay" would have been in Brythonic.)
  - What was the immediate fall-out?  Impact on demographics / politics / economy, in Britain / witherworld / abroad.
  - How did magical traditions survive until the present day?  (Good excuse to work in lots of mediæval occult lore and dramatis personae!)
+ How do Witherworld (theurgic) practitioners learn their magic?  In what order are spells taught?  Are there specific prerequisite exercises ("stare at this knot until it starts to make sense")?  At what point are practitioners capable in combat and/or with rituals?

## Influences

+ The gradual breakdown of equilibrium is basically a metaphor for climate change.
  - The Goetians are something along the lines of oil sheiks in this metaphor: they're exploiting a [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) situation.
    - I like [this article's take](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/) on office politics, which splits people into losers (who, faced with TotC, think "I'd better not graze any more sheep then"), clueless (who think "well, one more sheep won't hurt, right?") and sociopaths (who think "I'd better add as many sheep as possible, then, before everyone else can grow their flock").  Goetians are basically freelance sociopaths.
+ I like the [Laundry Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laundry_Files)' approach to magic: that it is basically extreme maths, with certain calculations resonating through the [Platonic realm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_idealism) to other realities.  Can't rip this off directly, since everyone in Europe between the Greeks and the Renaissance sucked balls at mathematics, but I'll include plenty of hat tips.
  - "Both a field and a particle" is a reference to quantum field theory
  - The idea of extra directions - widdershins and sidereal - is sorta-kinda related to the mathematics of imaginary and complex numbers, which makes descriptions like "north of the North Pole", "behind the West Wind" and "over hill and under dale" distressingly literal.
    - ... of course this would imply that there are *two* widdershins directions (for the same reason that the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) is symmetrical).  Summer and Winter Courts?
  - I also like the LF's approach of saving the world with reality-warping powers involving a lot of meetings and paperwork.  It just feels so damn plausible.
  - The collapse of the seal is basically [Case Nightmare Green](https://thelaundryfiles.fandom.com/wiki/CASE_NIGHTMARE_GREEN), which itself is ripped from Lovecraft.  ("When the stars were right, They could plunge from world to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong, They could not live.")
+ [Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Strange_%26_Mr_Norrell) has some very vivid imagery, and a similar (albeit somewhat more positive) take on the otherworld and the return of magic.
  - "This land is all too shallow / It is painted on the sky / And it shivers like the wind-swept leaves / When the Raven King goes by..."
+ The [Rivers of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Grant_(book_series)) series has a few similar themes: a handful of practitioners working to preserve order as the magic begins to return to England.
+ The orphan-thief entry point is a bit similar to how Jay (Will Smith) from [Men in Black](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119654/) got involved in extra-terrestrial affairs, albeit with a slightly stronger risk of being obliviated into a coma if he [refuses the call](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCallKnowsWhereYouLive).
  - "A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it." - best line ever
+ The breaches are reminiscent of [Primeval](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0808096/), a TV show about Suddenly Dinosaurs.
+ I need to be careful *not* to take too much influence from Artemis Fowl.  'Tis a silly series.
+ The sense that all the crazy has been trapped behind thin walls is reminiscent of the [Nasuverse](https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Nasuverse)'s [Reverse Side of the World](https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Reverse_Side_of_the_World) where the Age of Man never kicked off and the Age of Gods still holds sway.
