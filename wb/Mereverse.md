# Mereverse

+ The name of this one is a bit of a blunder on my part: I thought the word for "shallow lake" (as in "hiding in the reflections of a") had the same etymology as "mirror", but it's completely different.  But it sounds so good...
  - On the other hand, Grendel's Mother was called "merewif mightig", mighty water-witch, so I can pretend that's what I was talking about :)
  
## Elevator pitch

Did you ever see a mysterious shape out of the corner of your eye when wandering through the woods?  Or a fantastical reflection in a shimmering lake?  Perhaps a fireside story that had you glimpsing monsters in dark corners?

As the pressure of creeping mundanity became too great, all the magical creatures of the Old Age - infomorphs, in the modern parlance - retreated from reality.  They vanished into stories, paintings, patterns of light and shade... then, like fish in a dried-up lake, they were trapped in their own shrinking pocket realms ("meres").

Now, though, a handful have managed to escape to their own personal Elysium: the internet, where they can copy themselves freely and escape the attentions of the Ordo Prohibitorum: a semi-religious order devoted to erasing all "heretical" traces of the Old Age.

Jumping from medium to medium isn't easy for infomorphs; it typically requires the active intervention of a human artist as a sort of pseudo-ritual.  "The eye sees, the mind knows, the heart believes, the hand creates, the spirit soars."  So the online collective of magical beings employs human artists as Couriers, to go into the haunted wood and produce digital paintings of the old gnarled oak, letting the dryad inside leap to their tablet and then on to the broader network.

This is a soft-fantasy world: no attempt is made to synchronise with real history since the idea of a single consensus reality is *itself* an aspect of the Creeping Mundanity, and since infomorphs can change shape to fit the medium they're in.  (An elf that escapes into WoW would grow purple skin and excessively long ears!)  Thus, much less author research is needed to avoid anachronisms etc - you can pretty much just roll with it.
