# How to Do Bonsai (on the Cheap)

## Meta - remove before release

### To do
+ Finish first draft of outline
+ Identify most critical areas for course
+ Discuss course date (best for repotting / pruning?), length, attendance, budgets, prep (tree availability), etc with Oli
+ Flesh out into training deck/notes + presenter's notes

## Intro to bonsai (on the cheap)

### Why we appreciate bonsai
+ Bonsai brings nature into the home
+ Bonsai has style
	- Japanese / outdoor
	- Chinese / indoor
	- "I Can't Believe It's Not Bonsai"
+ Bonsai has history
+ Bonsai has convenience (kinda...)

### How we appreciate bonsai
+ Japanese styles
+ Qualities
	- Appearance of age
		- Ramification
		- "Nebari" (root flare - one of three japanese words you want to know)
	- Focus or dynamism
	- Gimmicks: size, fruit, flowers, ???
+ Misc fluff
	- Buddhist principles
	- General Japanese-ness

### How bonsai get to that point:
+ Kept alive for decades
	- Watering (!!!)
	- Pest control (!)
	- Heat (esp. wrt dormancy for outdoor, chills for indoor)
	- Light
	- Fertilising (micronutrients)
	- Air circulation (?)
+ Given treatment that lets them thrive (in the desired directions)
	- Cleaning & weeding
	- Fertilising (NPK)
	- Pruning (recapitulate the natural history)
	- Repotting (force a strong root ball rather than unnecessary deep/wide roots)
+ ...Occasional drastic action
	- Styling with Extreme Prejudice
		- trunk splitters
		- root over rock
		- root on rock
		- kokedama
		- forests
		- deadwood styling: jin, shari, uro(?); break out the power tools >:-D
	- Propagating with Extreme Prejudice
		- Grafting
		- Layering
		- Air layering
		- Just cutting big chunks off and trying to grow them
	- Sticking in ground
	- This section not discussed further here
+ Prepping for display
	- Pot aesthetics: shape/finish/decoration, "masculine" vs "feminine"
	- Ornaments, accent plants and display rocks
	- Last-minute fixes: moss, small branch wiring
	- Stands & displays
	- This section not discussed further here
+ <Lifecycle diagram>

### Doing it on the cheap
+ Easy ways to start bonsai:
	- Mature bonsai (i.e. large trunk relative to pot; good distinctive shape; has stopped trying too hard to grow)
	- Large numbers (nurseries)
	- Large pots (water control)
	- Lots of outside growing space, light/shade, etc
	- Good-quality specialist tools & materials (pots, soils, wire etc)
	- Experienced bonsai instructor
	...£££ (or apprenticeship)
+ The alternative: YOLO / for science!
	- Cheap "material": urban yamadori, seeds/cuttings, knocked-down stock, rescued ICBINB
	- Improvised tools
	- Iterative: expect many to die; goal is to learn from mistakes
	- Training sources: Youtube, community, amateur instructors (!)
+ If your tree is healthy and attractive, how you got there is less important

## Caring for bonsai

### Why is it so f***ing difficult?

+ The practitioner is God
+ What trees naturally get from the environment (that we provide)

### Watering
+ Significance
	- This _is_ what will kill your first few bonsai!
	- Under-watering: root hairs die off
	- Over-watering: root rot sets in (esp. when overcompensating)
	- Trad. bonsai soil drains well, is esp. prone to drying out completely
+ When to water
	- Back-of-hand test
	- Varies based on: bonsai/pot size; season (and location); species
+ Approaches:
	1. Dunking (up to slightly below the soil surface; until dampness

### Pest control (!)

+ Leaf pests
	- Aphids / greenfly
	- Spider mites
	- Leaf miners (fly larvae)
	- Weevils
+ Root pests
	- Grubs
	- Ants
	- (Some) nematodes
+ Not all wrigglies are pests!
	- Earthworms
	- Springtails
	- Woodlice
	- Ladybirds
+ Management options
	- Natural vs natural-but-lethal vs artifical-but-specific vs ALL TEH CHEMZ

### Heat (esp. wrt dormancy for outdoor, chills for indoor)

### Light
+ Significance:
	- There's this thing called "photosynthesis", y'know?
	- Quantity (lumens) vs colour (wavelength)
	- Too little: leaves die
	- Too much: leaves scorch
+ Management options
	- Expensive light measurement tool
	- Phone app
	- Just ignore it unless your plants start dying

### Fertilising
+ Significance
	- Micronutrients are needed for day-to-day plant metabolism
	- Too little or too much: leaves go funny colours
+ Management
	- High-quality organic fertilisers: biogold etc
	- Low-quality fertilisers: seaweed juice etc
	- Plant tonics

### Air circulation

+ Significance
	- There are these things called "oxygen", "carbon dioxide" and "dust"...
	- My instructor reckons this is necessary for plant health
	- I reckon that, unless you're sticking your tree in a sealed box, this is not a big deal for trees
	- (Mosses, on the other hand...)
	- Too little: plant generally unhealthy
	- Too much: plant blows over or loses leaves
+ Management: windows, fans
